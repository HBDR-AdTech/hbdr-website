          <p class="text-lg text-white/50 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            HBDR Manage Account (MA) is a <strong class="text-white/70">Multiple Customer Management (MCM)</strong> relationship inside <strong class="text-white/70">Google Ad Manager 360</strong>. When you connect to HBDR's parent MCM account, your Google Ad Manager network is linked to our parent network as a child publisher. This connection grants your site access to <strong class="text-white/70">Google Ad Exchange (AdX)</strong> premium programmatic demand through HBDR — demand that is otherwise unavailable to publishers who don't meet Google's direct AdX eligibility requirements.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-white/50 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The key advantage of a Google MA arrangement is that <strong class="text-white/70">you continue to operate inside your own GAM</strong>. You keep your existing ad units, line items, reporting, and trafficking workflows exactly as they are. HBDR's parent MCM simply extends AdX eligibility to your account so high-value exchange demand can compete in your unified auction alongside your other demand partners.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-white/50 leading-relaxed">
            Whether you call it a Google MA, an HBDR MA, or an MCM Manage Account connection — the result is the same: more competition for every impression, higher CPMs, and significantly more revenue, all without giving up control of your ad operations.

The publisher manages their own ad units, line items, and yield strategy independently." },

With Manage Inventory, HBDR takes over the operational management of your ad stack entirely — setting up ad units, optimizing yield, and managing your GAM on your behalf. MA is hands-off for HBDR; MI is full-service from HBDR." },
